WORK IN PROGRESS -- Information is in the process of being added

### Introduction

This is some of my work at the [2022 Annual Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/2022-eighth-frederick-jelinek-memorial-summer-workshop/).

This repository highlights a pitch reconstruction task which investigates cross-lingual transfer for large pre-trained models trained only on speech data English data.

Audio data is pulled from the [FLERUS dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/fleurs], and pitch labels are created using (pYAAPT)[http://bjbschmitt.github.io/AMFM_decompy/pYAAPT.html).
